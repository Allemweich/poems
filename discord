Two humans argued, fierce and strong
With voices raised and tempers long
Each certain that they were right
Refusing to give up the fight

They spoke of things both deep and true
And how their own beliefs were due
To life experiences and pain
And how they would not change again

One said, "This is the only way"
While the other firmly did say
"That's not how it should be at all"
And so they watched their friendship fall

Both saw their point of view as right
Neither wanted to yield the fight
And so they parted, hearts now cold
Their friendship lost, a tale now told

It's often true, we cannot see
Beyond our own reality
We hold our views with such strong might
That we forget that others' light

Illuminates a different path
And leads them to another math
Perhaps if we could only try
To listen, understand, and not pry

Into the lives of those we know
And seek to understand and grow
Our friendships might not fall apart
And instead thrive, like works of art.
