The code was fast, and its safety clear,
But the bugs remained, with a taunting sneer,
The programmer, in disbelief and despair,
Wished he'd stayed with the old software.

The Rust program stands, with syntax so bright,
But the logical errors, they refuse to take flight,
And the programmer, with a heart so blue,
Wonders if there's a language, that can make the bugs anew.
