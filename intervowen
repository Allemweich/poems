Each one of us, a different star,
We shine so bright, yet from afar,
Our light appears so far apart,
As though we're not part of one heart.

But as we journey through this life,
Our stories interweave in strife,
And though we start from different ends,
Our paths can converge, and then blend.

For as we navigate this sphere,
Our journeys bring us ever near,
To others who may seem so strange,
But with whom we can exchange

A smile, a laugh, a helping hand,
And start to build a common band,
Of people seeking to connect,
And find the ties that intersect.

The stories that we each create,
May differ much in time and fate,
But in the end, they can combine,
To form a tapestry that's divine.

So let us embrace our differences,
And find the beauty in our instances,
For in the end, we all play a part,
In weaving the fabric of the heart.
