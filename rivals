The morning sun climbs up the sky,
A new day dawns, and I don't lie,
As I step out, my heart beats fast,
For there she is, my shadow cast.

A rival to my every aim,
With confidence she plays her game,
For what I seek, she seeks as well,
And she'll stop at nothing, I can tell.

Her beauty hides a cunning mind,
A threat to me, it's not unkind,
She'll take what's mine, I fear and loathe,
For all I have, she'll gladly clothe.

I must stay sharp, keep her in sight,
For in this race, it's win or fight,
No shelter from the storm she brews,
As I try to walk in her shoes.

The evening creeps with stealth and grace,
As I shut out the world's mad race,
My heart beats fast, I know it's true,
For there he stands, my heart askew.

A rival to my every dream,
With cunning ways, or so it seems,
For what I want, he wants the same,
And he'll stop at nothing, I proclaim.

His words are coated with deceit,
A threat to me, I can't unseat,
For what he has, he'll never share,
And leave me here with naught to spare.

I must stay wise, and one step quick,
For in this game, there's no fair trick,
No truth to the storm he brews,
As I try to walk in his shoes.
